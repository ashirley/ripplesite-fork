<h4>Ripple Concept</h4>

<a name="collect"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>How do I collect my money?</i></p>
<p>When you get paid through Ripple, you are left being owed by one or more of your
neighbours.  You may use those obligations to purchase whatever you can by
paying them to someone through the system.  Of course, you may pay them right
to one of your neighbours for whatever they have to offer you, including cash.

<p>Until there is a critical mass of users, buying exactly what you want using
Ripple may be difficult, therefore if settling in cash is important to you, you 
should make this clear to your neighbours so they will not be surprised when you
ask them for money.  Also, take care to not offer credit limits that are too high,
or collecting may become a problem.  Remember, someone may become indebted to you
not just for what you or they have done on the system, but also for what others have
done through the connection between you!</p>
<br/>

<a name="why_ripple"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>Why would I want to use Ripple when I can use regular money?</i></p>
<p>In short, because it is cheaper to use and because your friends are a more wholesome
source of credit than banks.  Not only will your friends be more understanding if
you need to miss a few payments for a good reason, but they will also be more
likely to help you out if your spending habits are getting unhealthy.</p>

<a name="barter"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>Is Ripple a barter system?</i></p>
<p>No.  Ripple is a monetary system, with all the benefits of money over barter,
such as not having to find someone who wants exactly what you're offering before
you can get something you want.  In a sense, all monetary systems are about 
providing a way to flexibly store value to enable more efficient exchanges, which 
could be called "delayed-gratification barter".  But no, Ripple has nothing to
do with barter.</p>
<br/>

<a name="lets"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>Is Ripple a LETS system?</i></p>
<p>Ripple was inspired by <a href="http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/">the LETS concept
and the writings of Michael Linton</a>, and was conceived originally as a way
to bring more accountability into the spending of credits in a LETS system.
Unlike LETS, which only tracks obligations to and from a single central intermediary,
Ripple tracks obligations between individuals in a social network.  In practice,
many LETS users and administrators have complained that LETS provides little incentive
to make good on one's obligations other than the desire to have the system work.
In Ripple, obligations are never to "the system", or to some other collective entity,
but in specific amounts to specific individuals who have agreed to trust you, and
the loss of whose trust would have a tangible effect on a participant's life should
they decide to renege on their obligations.</p>

<p>Put another way, Ripple is like an interconnected network of LETS systems, each
operated by an individual participant.  The subscribers to each individual's LETS
are his or her neighbours.  Each participant acts as a broker to exchange between
the LETS currencies they subscribe to.</p>

<a name="pre-existing"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>How do I enter pre-existing debt into the system?</i></p>
<p>First, make a connection to the person you owe or who owes you the pre-existing
debt, and make sure that the person owing the debt is granted a high enough credit
limit to accomodate the amount of the debt.  Then, since payments in Ripple are 
actually IOUs, the person owing the debt would make a regular Ripple payment in the
amount owing to the person he or she owes.  That will change the balance on their
shared connection account to reflect the pre-existing debt.</p>
<br/>

<a name="cancel"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>How do I cancel debt on the system once it's been settled?</i></p>
<p>When two connected account partners settle a Ripple obligation outside the system, for example, by using
cash, the person receiving the settlement must record it in the system by returning
the settled IOUs to their issuer.  They do this by making a regular Ripple payment to
the person who settled their debt with you.  Your mutual account balance will be
changed to reflect the fact that the debt has been settled.  In effect, <a href="#collect">they are
using the IOUs they hold on the Ripple system to purchase cash.</a></p>
<br/>

<a name="close"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>How do I close down a connection account?</i></p>
<p>When you no longer wish to have a shared credit account with someone on the 
Ripple system, you may close the account, but only if the balance is zero.
First, set both credit limits to zero.  Then arrange for the partner holding
the balance, if any, to make a payment on the system to make the balance zero,
and settle the debt outside the system.</p>  

<p>Alternatively, if you both have other active accounts, you may just wait for
through payments to settle the balance for you.  The zeroed credit limits will
prevent the balance from ever doing anything but shrink.</p>
<br/>

<a name="outside"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>Why is my account balance outside the credit limits I have set?</i></p>
<p>You have most likely reduced a credit limit below the current balance so as
to have placed the already-existing balance out-of-bounds.  Don't fear, the balance will not be
able to move any further out-of-bounds, and payments moving through you will likely
eventually move the balance into the new limits you have created.  You may wish
to <a href="#collect">settle some of the debt on the account with your partner to move the balance
back in-bounds.</a></p>
<br/>

<a name="add_up"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>Why do my account balances not add up?</i></p>
<p>So that no fractional cents are lost on exchanges between different units,
the system keeps accounts to 12 decimal places.  Since only two decimal digits
are displayed, rounding sometimes means that the totals appear to be off by
0.01.  The totals are in fact correct to two decimal places.  A future feature 
may enable accounts to be viewed to more decimal digits of precision to 
confirm this.</p>
<br/>

<a name="overall_change"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>Why does my account balance keep changing?</i></p>
<p>If you have accounts in several different currency units, and view your 
overall balance in any one currency (usually your default display units), 
your overall balance will fluctuate slowly over time as the exchange rates 
between currency units change.</p>
<br/>

<a name="units_change"></a>
<p><img src="/media/bullet.png"/> <i>Why does the total balance for each of my different currencies change?</i></p>
<p>When you are selected to be an intermediary for a payment, you may 
receive credits on an account in one currency, and pay out credits in another
currency.  So your total balance for the first currency would increase, and the 
total balance for the second would decrease by the same amount.  As exchange rates
change over time, you may find that any single through-payment may cause you a 
very small gain or loss for this reason.  If this makes you uncomfortable, you may
disable automatic conversion between currency units in your profile.  This will
force your total balances for each of your different currencies to remain the same
unless you make or receive payment in one of them.</p>
